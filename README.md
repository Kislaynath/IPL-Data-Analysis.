# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis Project using Python

## 🧠 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on IPL (Indian Premier League) datasets to uncover trends, insights, and performance metrics using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

The analysis focuses on understanding team performances, player achievements, and match trends across multiple IPL seasons.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze IPL match data to identify performance trends.  
- Visualize matches per season, winning teams, and toss decisions.  
- Practice real-world **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** techniques with Python data libraries.

---

## 📊 Project Summary
The analysis identifies and visualizes:
- Matches played per season  
- Most successful teams  
- Toss decision preferences  
- Top venues and players  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 🗓️ **Highest matches** were played during IPL **2011–2012 seasons**  
- 🏆 **Mumbai Indians** and **Chennai Super Kings** dominate overall wins  
- 🧢 Around **61% of captains** prefer to **field first** after winning the toss  
- 🏟️ **Eden Gardens** is the most frequently used stadium
